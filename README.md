# histogram-stretching-for-image-contrast-enhancement
enhance image contrast by histogram stretching implemented by python

histograms represent count of each brightness value from 0 to 255 in an image.
images with high quality , use all(or most of) brightnesses to form the image. therefor we would have a balance between dark and bright pixels

so a very simple method to enhance image contrast, is to stretch histogram by using basic mathematics (scaling and shifting). which i have implemented in python.

hope you like it.
